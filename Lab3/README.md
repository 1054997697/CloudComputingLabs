# Lab 3 Instruction

Lab 3: The First Distributed System 

1. Overview

2. Background

3. Your Lab Task

3.1 Write a program 

implementing the following features:

3.1.1 Program input

3.1.2	Program output

3.1.3	Implementation requirements 

3.1.3.1	Basic version

3.1.3.2	Advanced version

[Optimization tips]

3.2. Finish	a performance test report

Please test your code first, and commit a test report along with your lab code into your group’s course github repo. 
The test report should contain several sample test inputs, and the performance result under various testing conditions. Specifically, in your test report, you should at least contain the following two things:
1)	Compare the performance of your “super-fast” word-count program with a simple single-thread version, using the same input and under the same environment.
2)	Change the input (e.g., change file size, word pattern) and environment (e.g., using machines with different CPUs and hard drives), and draw several curves of your program’s performance under various conditions.

4. Lab submission

Please submit your lab program and performance test report following the guidance in the [Overall Lab Instructions](../README.md)

5. Grading standards
