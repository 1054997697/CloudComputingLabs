# CloudComputingLabs

==================================================

This is the repo containing all the lab materials for undergraduate course CS06142 "Cloud Computing Techniques" at Hunan University 

==================================================

Overall Lab Instructions

1.	Overview

There are 4 labs in total in this course. Lab 1-3 are compulsory. Lab 4 is optional. The materials of each lab are under folders Lab1-4 in this repo. Please carefully read the each lab's instruction ([Lab1](Lab1/README.md), [Lab2](Lab2/README.md), [Lab3](Lab3/README.md), [Lab4](Lab4/README.md)) to get each lab's task, background, requirements, etc.

2.	Group collaboration

Each student should register your own github account, and each group should create a code repo for our course. Group members should use git and github to collaborate. All the labs are done in the unit of group, i.e., a group only needs to submit one piece of code for each lab. However, each group member should make enough contribution to the lab. Teaching assistants will check the commit history to evaluate each oneâ€™s contribution.

3.	Code submission

All the lab code should be submitted through committing and pushing to the github code repo. Teaching assistants will checkout your commit, and read and test your codes. The code of different lab should be in different folders, but should be in the same course git repo of your group.
Please write a README to each lab code folder, briefly introducing how to run your lab code (including how to set the environment, provide the input, and explain the output, etc.). Also, your code should be well commented so that other people can understand without asking you. 
All of our labs focus very much on the performance. So please DO submit a performance test report along with each of your lab code. Unlike your other courses, we do NOT require you to submit any lab report to explain your code structure or share your understandings or experiences during lab conduction.  

4.	Environment requirement

4.1 OS requirement

All the labs should be tested and runnable on UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) and MacOS. We highly recommend you to use Linux distributions such as Ubuntu.
If you only have windows PC or laptops, install a UNIX VM and do experiments on the VM.

4.2 Programming language

Any programming languages are permitted in all labs, such as C/C++, Java, Go, Python, Perl. But for performance consideration, we highly recommend you to use C/C++ or Go !!!

4.3 3rd-party libraries

Any 3rd-party libraries are NOT permitted to be used in all the labs. All the labs should be written from scratch, based on original functions and libraries (such as glibc and C++ STLs) offered by programming-language. Also, all the labs should only use standard system API defined by POSIX specification or Linux man page specification. We prefer to use standard POSIX API, so your code can be easily runnable on various kind of UNIX-like systems (instead of only on Linux).
